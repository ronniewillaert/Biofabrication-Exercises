# Biofabrication Exercises

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with exercises for the **Biofabrication** course (Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1st Master in Bioengineering).

The notebooks can be opened directly in **Google Colab** ‚Äî no installation required.  
Click the badge below each chapter to launch the interactive exercises.
