## 📘 Chapter 5 – Bioreactors and tissue maturation
## Chapter 5 — Bioreactors and Tissue Maturation (Interactive)

**What you’ll explore**
- **Diffusion–reaction in tissues (Fick’s laws)** with sliders for \(D_e\), \(k\), slab thickness \(L\), and time horizon.
- **Wall shear stress** in rectangular perfusion channels; sweep flow to see physiological ranges.
- **Perfusion design helper** using Péclet and Damköhler numbers with regime hints and quick plots.

**Launch in Colab**
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](
https://colab.research.google.com/github/ronniewillaert/Biofabrication-Exercises/blob/main/Chapter5_Interactive_Exercises_with_Widgets.ipynb)

**Learning objectives**
- Interpret **Fick’s 1st/2nd laws** in the context of 3D tissues; relate to penetration depth \(L_p \approx \sqrt{D/k}\).
- Estimate **shear stress** from geometry and flow; compare to endothelial physiological ranges (≈0.5–2 Pa).
- Use **Pe, Da\(_I\), Da\(_{II}\)** to reason about diffusion vs. convection vs. consumption in perfusion bioreactors.

**Suggested activities**
- Match diffusion parameters to **Figure 5.4** profiles from the syllabus.
- Tune flow until shear is physiological; then check how Pe and Da shift with velocity.
- Design a perfusion regime that keeps concentration >90% across a 1-mm scaffold and justify with Pe/Da.
